    <h1>Jollof Rice Recipe</h1>
    <p>Jollof rice is a staple West African dish. It is made from rice, tomatoes, onions, peppers, and other seasonings. The dish is usually cooked in one pot and it is very easy to prepare making it one of the most sort after delicacy in West Africa - especially Nigeria.</p>
    <p>And Nigerian Jollof is absolutely better than Ghana Jollof by the way.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>The ingredients required for making jollof rice are pretty basic, and you probably already have them in your kitchen.</p>
        <li>The main ingredient for making jollof rice is, of course <strong>rice.</strong></li>
        <li>Canned tomato, fresh tomatoes, fresh pepper, onions, garlic, and ginger.</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil(You can use any brand of your choice)</li>
        <li>Stock - Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock are great choices here for adding depth of flavour.</li>
        <li>Lastly, we'll need seasonings and herbs; curry powder, salt, bouillon powder, thyme and bay leaves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Cook Jollof Rice</h2>
    <p>When preparing Jollof rice, building a flavour base is very important. Don't be in a hurry to dump all your ingredients in the pot, otherwise, you'll probably end up cooking something terrible.</p>
    <li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by <strong>sauteing the Onions.</strong> This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the ginger and garlic</strong> and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the blended tomatoes mix.</strong> Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
    <li>Finally, in building my flavor, I <strong>add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes.</strong> Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</li>
    <li>Once the flavor is on point, then, I <strong>stir in the Rice.</strong> Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
    <li>Now <strong>add the chicken stock.</strong> Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
    <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to <strong>cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.</li>
