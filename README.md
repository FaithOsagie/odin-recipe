# odin-recipe

This project is an assignment from The Odin Website, it is supposed to track what i learnt in the first part of their foundational course.

I am basically using this project as a means to practice using git and github as i really don't know how it works.

So far, I have been able to use the `add, push, commit, log, and status commands.` This was very stressful, but I really enjoyed the process.

I was also able to work on using ubuntu on wsl. Although copying files from the main windows directory to the linux directory was pretty stressful, I was able to navigate and solve this problem all by myself with chatgpt or any AI. 

This thrill is amazing.
