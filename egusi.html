    <h1>Egusi Soup Recipe</h1>
    <p>Egusi soup is unarguably one of the most popular Nigeria soups. It is a traditional soup that combines blended melon seed, pepper, leafy vegetables and meat or fish.</p>
    <p>It is very tasty and can be spicy too, depending in your preference.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <p>These are the ingredients needed for making egusi soup.</p>
       <li><strong>Ground Egusi Melon:</strong> this is the main ingredient for making egusi soup. It can be gotten in seed or already processed form from the market or super market.</li>
       <li><strong>Palm Oil:</strong> used to cook the pepper mix as a base before adding the egusi. it adds color and a great depth of flavor to the soup.</li> 
       <li><strong>Beef, Dried-fish or Crayfish:</strong> these are protein sources for a hearty soup. Feel free to add whatever variety of protein you prefer.</li>
       <li><strong>Meat Stock:</strong> this is an optional but a worthwhile seasoning addition.</li>
       <li><strong>Pepper Mix:</strong> the pepper should contain red pepper, tomato and onions. And of course, it should be blended.</li>
       <li><strong>Salt and Seasoning Cubes:</strong> you wouldn't want to go cooking without these now would you?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Guidelines for cooking Egusi</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the pepper, tomatoes and onion together into a mix.</li>
        <li>Blend the egusi melon if it isn't ground already.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pot or pan - make sure to not overheat or bleach it.</li>
        <li>Add the blended pepper mix into the heated oil and fry for 15 to 20 minutes until it is well cooked.</li>
        <li>Then add the ground egusi melon. It is important to not stir the egusi at this point; give it time to curdle. Once it has curdled for about 15 minutes, stir it briefly, then add your meat stock and your meat or protein and leave to cook for another 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook until properly done and your egusi is ready to be served with any swallow of your choice.</li>
